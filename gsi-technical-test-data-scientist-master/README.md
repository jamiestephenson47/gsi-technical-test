# Technical Test (Data Scientist) 

As part of the selection process, we require all candidates for Data Scientist positions to complete a technical test. 

Whilst completing the tasks below, we would like you to consider using the following software development techniques where it is sensible: 

* PEP8 coding conventions 
* Version control 
* Dependency management 
* Testing (we are not expecting 100% code coverage, one or two tests to demonstrate understanding is plenty) 

You can take as much time as you need to complete the exercises, but weâ€™d suggest you spend no more than 2 hours even if you did not complete all the steps.

## Task 1: Explore geospatial data in a Jupyter Notebook 

This task is designed to assess your ability to interact with geospatial data.

### 1. Load the data 

Using [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/index.html) and [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) load `data/buildings.sample.geojson` and `data/image.grey.tif` respectively. 

### 2. Inspect the data 

Output some appropriate summary information about each of the datasets. 

### 3. Plot the data 

Plot the image data from `image.grey.tif` with the building data from `buildings.sample.geojson` overlaid.  

Notes:

* Within the image data there are outliers, you will need to clamp them to properly visualise the data 
* The [rasterio.features.rasterize](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.features.html#rasterio.features.rasterize) function can be useful for this task 

## Task 2: Build a simple model

This task is designed to test your modelling ability within a simple context.

In this task you will use building attributes (do not try and use the image) to infer the buildings roof material.

`data/buildings.csv` contains building data with the below attributes:

|            | Description               | Type
|------------|---------------------------| ------------ |
| roof_type1 | Roof geometry type        | Categorical  |
| address    | Address of the building   | Free Text    |
| latitude   | Latitude of the building  | Continuous   |
| longitude  | Longitude of the building | Continuous   |
| height_m   | Height of the building    | Continuous   |
| area_m2    | Area of the building      | Continuous   |
| city       | The city of the building  | Categorical  |
| roof_mat   | The roof material         | Categorical  |

Using the columns of your choice fit a model that can predict the `roof_mat` attribute.
 
Explain some of the expected strengths and the weaknesses of your model.

Explain what some sensible next steps would be to improve your model.

## Task 3: Write a data loading class

This task is designed to test your ability to write clean code relevant to data science pipeline.

In a new Python module `data.py` write a class `BuildingDataset` that loads one building at a time with an interface that enables the following interaction: 

Notes:
* You can load a portion of the image data using the [rasterio.windows](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/windowed-rw.html) module

[in]:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from data import BuildingDataset 

ds = BuildingDataset("data/image.grey.tif", "data/buildings.sample.geojson")
image, mask = ds.get(0)

plt.imshow(image, cmap="gray")
plt.imshow(mask, alpha=0.1)
plt.axis("off")

plt.savefig("assets/output.png")
```
[out]:
